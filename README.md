# Budget App  
Oh hi there, this is a simple budgeting app I'm working on. Any critique or update is appreciated. I am new to the Java language and trying to create something to learn more about it!

# Features so far
- Main menu GUI
- Income/Spending GUI
- Income saves to a list of expenses
- Spendings saves to a list of expense

# Future Features 
- ~~Spendings saves to the lists of expenses~~
- Report GUI (Includes all Income, spendings, and the total saved or lost in table format) 
- Serialize objects so that previous sessions can be loaded up
- Export report to PDF (Maybe)
- Produce daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports (Maybe)
- Network socket connections (Big maybe)
